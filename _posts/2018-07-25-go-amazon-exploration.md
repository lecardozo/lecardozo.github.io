Back in 2016, me and [Diogenes](https://twitter.com/diogenes_lim) were given the task
of extracting insights out of some Green Ocean Amazon (GOAmazon) data sets. The GOAmazon
experiment was designed and implemented by a partnership between the United States Department
of Energy (DOE), SÃ£o Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) and Amazonas Research Foundation (FAPEAM),
in order to better understand how some land-atmosphere processes impacted in the climate and
hydrology in the Amazon basin [1] . To do so, researchers collected lots of data about weather (e.g. temperature, 
relative humidity, wind strenght and direction) and about the atmosphere (e.g. carbon dioxide concentration)
throughout 5 research sites in the surroundings of Manaus (Amazon State capital).

Even though we knew absolutely nothing about climate/weather/enviroment data analysis,
we faced the challenge ('cause, why not?) and started to perform the usual exploratory
data analysis. We decided to choose R for this exploratory work (basically because we both knew it and 'cause ggplot2 is :heart:).
All the code can be found in [this Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/lecardozo/explorations/blob/master/amazon-forest/exploration.ipynb).

### The data
Before start working with new data sets there is always this kind of **fear of the unknown**.
We keep questioning ourselves: _"What does the data look like? Is it structured or not? What are the available variables?
Will us be able to understand the meaning of those variables?"_. Luckily, GOAmazon researchers and engineers
made a great job providing us with structured and documented data sets.

The experiment sensors collected data every minute (or so) for two consecutive years (2014 and 2015). For each timestamped record
we had the following variables:
 - Air temperature
 - Atmospheric pressure
 - Carbon monoxide concentration
 - Water (vapor) concentration
 - Dinitrogen oxide concentration
 - Rain
 - Relative humidity
 - Wind direction
 - Wind speed


### Exploratory Data Analysis
One main tools in the exploratory data analysis toolbelt is the data visualization. Visually looking for general trends, outliers and
relationships between different variables is an essential task before asking any questions or formulating hypothesis. 

#### - *Take a look at your distributions!*
So after some data aggregations, filtering and reshaping (you know, pre-processing stuff that is essential but generallly omitted) we finally can
start visualizing! The almost always first choice for having a general idea about continuous variables is plotting its distributions.

<figure>
   <img alt="Variables distribution" src="/assets/goamazon/distribution.png">
   <figcaption><i>Distribution of each variable from January of 2014 to December of 2015.</i></figcaption>
</figure>

This kind of visualization brings us some useful information. We can now see what are lower and upper bounds for each 
variable (this is good, specially if you are not familiar with these variables). We can also verify if the distributions
are similar to those most known distributions (does it looks like a Gaussian? Poisson?). Last but not least, we can have
a general idea about the existence of outlier records (I'm talking about you CO, H<sub>2</sub>O, N<sub>2</sub>O and Rain)

Cool, but what's next? What we have in hand is time series data, so, the most logic thing
to look for now is how do these variables behave across time! Let's see how it goes.


#### - *How do your variables vary across time?*

<figure>
   <img alt="Variables across time" src="/assets/goamazon/timeseries.png">
   <figcaption><i>Fluctuation of each variable across 2014 and 2015, plotted by day.</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Now let's get into some interesting stuff we can see here. Gases (CO, H<sub>2</sub>O and N<sub>2</sub>O) apparently 
show some similar patterns: they present standard concentrations during almost the whole year with the 
exception of some especific periods when the concentrations show a huge increase. What does it mean? Are those sensors
sensors broken? Can we trust our data? Is this how it ends?

<figure style="text-align:center">
   <img class="center-image" alt="Doubt" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7WTqo27pLRYxRtg4/giphy.gif">
   <figcaption>

   </figcaption>
</figure>

How do we know if this is a problem in the data collection procedure 
(broken/uncalibrated sensor) or signal from a real phenomena? Should we just remove those 
values before performing the next analysis? Let's just leave it there for now
while we take a look at the other variables.


#### - *The good ol' correlations*
Another good friend of yours are the scatter plots and correlation matrices. They can help
you have a general notion of positive/negative relationships between your variables
(not saying causality here, folks). I'm not going to show the whole correlation matrix
here (you can find it [here](https://github.com/lecardozo/explorations/blob/master/amazon-forest/exploration.ipynb)).
Most of the pairwise absolute correlations are not strong, with the exception
of the correlation between the **air temperature** and **relative humidity**, which is a strong
negative correlation (Pearson -0.961). If we aggregate those variables by hour and plot it,
this is what we see:

<figure style="text-align:center">
   <img class="center-image" alt="Doubt" src="/assets/goamazon/rh-temp.png">
   <figcaption>
       Air temperature and relative humidity across the day.
   </figcaption>
</figure>


For those who are not familiar with this scientific domain (like us), this instantly looks 
appealing but, actually, this is just well-known obvious stuff.
In simple words, when the air temperature increases, the air can hold more water,
so the _relative_ humidity decreases. Even though this does not looks super nice anymore, it
shows us that at least the air temperature relative humidity sensors were well and functioning.
Now, let's get back to our potential outliers. :eyes:


#### - *Oh, the outliers*
There is a quote from a famous philosopher that goes something link this:
> Outliers. To remove or not to remove? - Bob Marley, 2014

This is a question that always arise. In bioinformatics, experimental outliers, caused by, for instance,
sample contamination, different protocols or even uncalibrated devices, can
completely affect your results. So, in general we exclude them because they can cause more harm then if we leave
it there - unless its some hard to get data, which, in this case, we think twice before removing it.

We decided to take a deeper look into our current outliers, to see if we can find some patterns in it. We selected
the the carbon monoxide (CO) variable as our first candidate. In order to find some year trend in the outlier appearance,
we grouped the data by year and month and plotted it. Here is the result:

<figure style="text-align:center">
   <img class="center-image" alt="Doubt" src="/assets/goamazon/co-year.png">
</figure>

Interesting, right?! Apparently the potential outliers only occur between August and October of both years.
This visualization led us to think that thos outlier observations were problably not being caused by sensor
failures. What the heck is causing those discrepant observations? Time to create some hypothesis, friends!


#### - *Hypothesis time!*
If you have a good memory, you remember that all this data was collected in the surroundings of Manaus,
specifically in a small city, Manacapuru, located southwestern to Manaus. In the following map you can
see Manacapuru right in the center.


<figure style="text-align:center">
   <img class="center-image" alt="Doubt" src="/assets/goamazon/manacapuru.png">
</figure>


Manaus has a free-trade zone with different kinds of national and transnational industries. 
With that information in mind, out first hypothesis was: *extreme values of CO in Manacapuru are 
probably a consequence of CO release __from industries located in Manaus__*. This, however, doesn't 
explain why the extreme values only show up between August and October. So we thought that this
might be related with some *seasonal changes in the wind direction and speed*. Maybe, in this specific 
months, the wind was dragging CO from Manaus to Manacapuru.

<figure style="text-align:center">
   <img class="center-image" alt="Doubt" src="/assets/goamazon/hypothesis.png" style="width: 180px">
   <figcaption>
       Me, after formulating the hypothesis.
   </figcaption>
</figure>

To evaluate this, we decided to take a look  at the wind directions across the months.

<figure style="text-align:center">
   <img class="center-image" alt="Doubt" src="/assets/goamazon/winddir.png">
</figure>

Considering the geographical position of Manacapuru and Manaus, in order to corroborate our hypothesis,
we would expect to see more wind heading to West and South in August, September and October. According to the 
windrose plots, there's no evidence of significant changes in the wind direction during this period. :sweat:

If there is no evidence of the influence of the wind direction in our CO measures, what else could be responsible for that?
What about talking with someone who might know more about this scientific domain than me?


#### - *Domain knowledge*
I decided to talk with an environmental engineer - who is also, by coincidence, my sister.
We started discussing what kinds of processes could increase the concentration of carbon monoxide in the air.
Considering that CO is the result of incomplete combustion, we thought that would be nice to see if there is
any evidence of fire in the region, which might explain those patterns.

Alright, now I need fire data from that specific region. Where 
would I find it? For my surprise, it was easier than expected. There exists a system called 
Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS-NASA) that allows you to
download Near Real-Time (NRT) fire data collected daily by NASA satellites.

I requested all the fire event data between for 2014 and 2015. For each fire event we had data
about its location (`lat` and `lon`), the day it was collected, the confidence of the signal and some
other variables. After filtering the data by confidence, we plotted all the events for both
2014 and 2015 in the map, to see if there is any overlap with our region. This is what I've got:

<figure style="text-align:center">
   <img class="center-image" alt="Doubt" src="/assets/goamazon/fire-manacapuru.png">
</figure>

Wow! Each point here represents a fire event registered by the satellite, and there is A LOT
of points. But still, this does not mean anything to our hypothesis. If these events are uniformly
distributed across the months, this means that this data does not support our hypothesis. Thus,
we decided to group those events by month a plot it to the map to see what happens.

<figure style="text-align:center">
   <img class="center-image" alt="Doubt" src="/assets/goamazon/fire-manacapuru-year.png">
</figure>

OH YEAH! Apparently, for some reason, there is a high concentration of fire events between
August and October, both in 2014 and 2015. Although these fire events are far from being
random, we can't establish a causal relationship between them and the increase in carbon
monoxide (we would need some crazy experiment for that). After some more discussion
with my sister, we ended with two new hypothesis to explain what we were seeing.

- *Antropogenic process:* farmers using fire as a "cleaning" method for preparing their 
fields for the next crop (which is a terrible thing to do, but still pretty common).
- *Natural process:* this period of the year is the drought season in that region, which may
favour the occurence of natural fire. According to some authors [2], 2015 was the most extreme
of the 21st century, with respect to droughts.

Both presented hypothesis might be right (or wrong). There are several great scientists working
on understanding and describing processes and how they impact on things such as the global warming
. If your interested on these topics, check out [2-4]


### Conclusions
This whole work was a great experience. I've learned a lot about a scientific domain that I've never
worked with before. It also was important because it showed us that we cannot (and you also shoundn't)
underestimate the power of **data visualization** and, more importantly, **domain knowledge**.
As a data scientist your job is to understand the data you are dealing with. If you are not familiar
with this domain, sit down, grab a cup of coffee and read some review about it. It will a lot easier
to create cool hypothesis about the things your seeing in your data.
