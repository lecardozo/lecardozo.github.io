The very first post of this blog!

{% highlight python %}
print("Hello World!")
{% endhighlight %}

Here I'll be writing a little bit about things that are part of my daily life at lab.
Eventually, I'll write posts about problems that I've faced and solutions that I've found.
May this be a reference for "Lucas from the future" so he does not spent too much
time solving problems that "Lucas from the past" already solved.
