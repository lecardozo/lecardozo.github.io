I'm just a guy with some ~~high levels of~~ curiosity about tech/science stuff.

Started studying Python and R for bioinformatics in 2014. Since then, I've played with a lot of cool stuff! From bioinformatics pipelines to web applications, from R packages to Docker, from statistical learning to container clusters in the cloud.

I'm currently working on getting my Masters degree at [Computational Systems Biology Laboratory](http://csbiology.com) at University of SÃ£o Paulo.

For those who believe that *"you are what you ~~eat~~ listen to"*, here goes my list of favourite podcasts:
 - [Partially Derivative](http://partiallyderivative.com/)
 - [Software Engineering Daily](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/)
 - [Late Nights with Trav and Los](http://www.travandlos.com/)
